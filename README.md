# The Bat-Coder's Friendly Parakeet Password Generator

### Generator made with:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Password Generator

This password Generator creates a password based around the criteria that you yourself choose! The default length is 8 characters with UPPCASE font but what if you want lower case also? Or symbols and numbers? Of course, what if you want the password to be longer than 8 characters? Well, I got you covered! A series of prompts will appear after clicking the buttons will allow you to customize the password in this manner! A password completely unique to call your own!

Clicking cancel will set everything to their defauts which is as follows:

* Length: 8 characters
* Case: UPPER
* Numbers: No
* Symbols: No

It's easy to use, intuitive and worth the time if you're having trouble coming up with a password that is safe and secure!
